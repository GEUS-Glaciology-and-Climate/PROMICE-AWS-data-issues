* PROMICE AWS Data Issue

Automatic weather station (AWS) data from the Greenland Ice Sheet are often imperfect due to the complexity and conditions involved in installing and maintaining the AWS.

This goal of this project is to provide a public space to document and solve issues with [[https://www.promice.org/][PROMICE]] AWS data.
