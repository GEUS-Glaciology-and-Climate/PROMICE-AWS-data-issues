* PROMICE AWS Data Issue

Automatic weather station (AWS) data from the Greenland Ice Sheet is often imperfect due to the complexity and conditions involved in installing and maintaining the AWS.

This goal of this project is to provide a public space to document and solve issues with PROMICE AWS data.

* Workflow

+  If you are using PROMICE AWS data and something seems amiss, you can search the [[https://github.com/mankoff/PROMICE-AWS-data-issues/issues][issues]] to see if someone else has documented the issue.
  + Issues can be searched using [[https://github.com/mankoff/PROMICE-AWS-data-issues/labels][labels]], and filtered by Station Name, Year, or Sensor
  + The [[https://github.com/mankoff/PROMICE-AWS-data-issues/labels][label]] link lets you select only 1 label. For more complex searches you have to enter "label:<label>" in the search field.
  
+ Once an issue has been submitted, a PROMICE scientist will examine and add the [[https://github.com/mankoff/PROMICE-AWS-data-issues/labels/CONFIRMED][CONFIRMED]] label.

+ If an issue can be solved, a solution will be added to the issue and the [[https://github.com/mankoff/PROMICE-AWS-data-issues/labels/SOLUTION][SOLUTION]] label will be added.
